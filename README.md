# Creating/using scripts instead of manually encoding all lines
#
#
# For scripts of Chapters 5 & 6, the scripts assumed you finished executing up to Chapter 4.
# The username should be "lfs" and the location should be "/mnt/lfs/sources" directory.  That means the prompt should be:
# lfs:/mnt/lfs/sources$
#
#
# For scripts of Chapter 7 & up, the scripts assumed you finished executing Chapter/Section 7.2 to 7.6.
# the username should be "root", should had CHROOTed, and the location should be "/sources" directory.  That means the prompt should be:
# root:/sources#
#



#
# copy the script files ( *.sh ) in the said directory
#
